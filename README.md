# StudyBuddy
Students often struggle with time management, distraction, and burnout during long study sessions. There is a need for a simple, engaging tool that helps students track their focus time while keeping the experience fun and rewarding.

OBJECTIVES:
To develop a user friendly Desktop Application using Java Swing for time tracking.
to implement the Pomodoro Technique to improve concentration.
To create a "Gamified" experience using animated GIFs and comic-style feedback to reduce study fatigue.
To enable data persistence by saving study logs to a file to tracking progress over time.

CONCEPTS APPLIED:
OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming): Encapsulation, Inheritance
Swing (GUI): JFrame, JPanel, Timer, BorderLayout, GridLayout, and BoxLayout
Storage (File Handling): FileWriter, BufferedWriter, Scanner  
Exception Handling: try/catch

USES:
Academic Focus: Maintains disciplined study sessions with a Pomodoro timer.
Habit Tracking: Tracks weekly study time through the History feature.
Stress Reduction: Break mode and animations promote rest and prevent burnout.
Task Management: Current Task input keeps users focused on their goal.
